# 🚀 Nuxt 3 Starter

This is a starter project for nuxt 3. The following packages are preinstalled and minimally configured:

-   Nuxt UI (tailwind and some more packages are installed with it)
-   Zod
-   Prettier (and the tailwind plugin for it)
-   Lodash
-   VueUse

These are the core parts of any nuxt app that we develop. If you don't want to use nuxt ui you can simply remove it and install tailwind the usual way.

## 💻 Start developing

This starter is intended for use with bun instead of npm. If you don't have bun, follow [this link](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

**Install packages**:

```
bun install
```

**Start dev server**:

```
bun dev
```

You can also do `bun run dev`.

If you want to expose it, use the `--host` flag.

**Build the Project**:

```
bun build
```

## 📝 Notes

If you are using vscode and don't have tailwind intellisense then there might be a problem with the settings.json file.

## 🛩️ Plans for the future

In the future this starter will additionally include the following packages:

-   i18n
